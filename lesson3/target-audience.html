            <h4>Dave Chippy, Mid-Size Business CEO<br>
            </h4>
            <p>Dave is 53 years old, is married with 3 children and has a Master's degree in business. Dave is hoping to saturate the market with his brand Chippy Chips. He hopes to turn his local snack into a statewide and then national brand. Daveâ€™s goal is to gain local influence and support local causes. 
                He is happy in the boardroom, on the golf course, or taking his kids to the beach to try to surf. Mr. Chippy has installed vending machines with his product in every school across the city. His chips are available at local games and amusement parks.
                Dave will access the chamber website at his office on his desktop computer.</p>

        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
          <div>
            <p>The city is planning an event for Spring Break. Lori would like to create a vendor fair at the beach since families will be visiting from all over and may not see her shop. 
                She is hoping to rally other small business to participate in the vendor fair. Her plan is to rent as many of her beach rentals as possible at this event.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Dave wants to know when small businesses move to town so he can get a vending machine or delivery to that new retailer. 
                A new sandwich shop is opening soon and he would like them to offer Chippy Chips exclusively.
            <br>

            <p>A visitor to the island is hoping to find the weather for the upcoming week and find out what outdoor events are happeing at the beach.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A local resident would like to make purchases for an upcoming PTA event at her elementary school. She would like to know which local businesses are active in the community in giving back.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A little leaue team is looking for support for team sponsorship. The coach would like to see which businesses support local teams.</p>
